# LAF_ADVENTURE

Fit for anyone familiar with the quips and quirks of **Lafayette College**, this interactive choose-your-own-adventure game will take you all-around campus (as if you were back there in person!).

More specifically, your task is a _treasure hunt_, one of collecting the greatest riches the campus has to offer.  You will need to make choices about where to travel and what to keep in your backpack – you only have limited time and storage space.  When the day is up, you will present your bounty to President Byerly for her to judge. Good luck! (and cur non!)

Future additions:
  - "view map" action
  - "end hunt" action that totals and reports final score
  - random item placement in world
  - larger world / more tiles / more items
  - graphical interface for more engaging play
