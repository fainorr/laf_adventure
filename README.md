# LAF_ADVENTURE

Fit for anyone familiar with the quips and quirks of **Lafayette College**, this interactive choose-your-own-adventure game will take you all around campus (as if you were there in person!).

More specifically, your task is a _treasure hunt_, one of collecting the greatest riches the campus has to offer.  You will need to make choices about where to travel and what to keep in your backpack – you only have limited inventory space.  When your search is complete, you will present your bounty to President Byerly for her to judge. Good luck! (and cur non!)
